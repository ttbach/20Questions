20Questions
===========
This is an implementation of the game 20 Questions. 

The user thinks of something (for example, an animal), then the computer asks a series of yes/no questions to try to determine which type of food she is thinking of. 
There are two variations to this game: The choice of food is pre-specified, or the choice of food is unrestricted. 

The restricted version has pre-specified choices, while the unrestricted version has unrestricted choices.

How to run the program:
1. Download the program to desktop
2. Via the terminal or Eclipse, run either the the restricted version or unrestricted
3. Play a fun game
